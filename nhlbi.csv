Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/ards,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen levels.,"Difficulty breathing is usually the first symptom of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Other symptoms may vary depending on how serious the underlying
cause
is. ARDS may take several days to develop, or it can rapidly get worse.
Complications
may include
blood clots
, infections, additional lung problems, or organ failure.
Warning signs that you are developing or are at risk for ARDS may include:
Shortness of breath
Fast breathing, or taking lots of rapid, shallow breaths
Fast heart rate
Coughing that produces phlegm
Blue fingernails or blue tone to the skin or lips
Extreme tiredness
Fever
Crackling sound in the lungs
Chest pain, especially when trying to breathe deeply
Low blood pressure
Confusion
If you have trouble breathing or have severe shortness of breath,
call 9-1-1 right away.",N/A,N/A,"Your doctor will diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. ARDS can be difficult to diagnose and is often mistaken for another condition, so it is important to know your symptoms.","To help diagnose ARDS, your doctor may ask you about any medical conditions or recent events that could be considered risk factors. For example, traveling could be a risk factor because of potential exposure to infections that are more common in certain geographic areas.
Your doctor will also ask about your
symptoms
and whether you have a heart problem, such as
heart failure
, or another condition that can cause symptoms similar to those for ARDS.","Your doctor will examine you for signs of ARDS. This exam may include:
Listening to your lungs
through a stethoscope for abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling
Listening to your heart
for a fast heart rate
Checking for signs that you are having difficulty breathing,
such as using muscles in your chest to help you breathe
Examining your skin or lips for a bluish tone,
which can signal a low blood oxygen level
Examining your body for swelling
or other signs of extra fluid, which may be linked to heart or kidney problems
Measuring your blood pressure
and oxygen levels","To diagnose ARDS, your doctor may have you undergo some of the following tests and procedures. Different tests may be appropriate for different ages and can include:
Blood tests
measure the oxygen level in your blood, using a sample of blood taken from an artery. A low blood oxygen level might be a sign of ARDS. To confirm the cause of your symptoms, your doctor may also check your blood for signs of infection or a heart problem, or to see how well other organs are working.
Other tests of blood oxygen levels,
such as pulse oximetry, that do not require collecting a blood sample may be done. For these tests, a sensor is attached to the skin or placed on a hand or foot.
Lung imaging tests
,
such as a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan, create detailed images of your lungs.
Lung
biopsy
may be done if other tests do not confirm a diagnosis."

Angina (Chest Pain),https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/angina,Angina is chest pain or discomfort that happens when an area of the heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood. It is a common symptom of heart disease.,"Symptoms vary based on the
type of angina
you have. Angina symptoms can differ in severity, location in the body, timing, and degree of relief you get from rest or medicines. Symptoms can also be different for men and women.","The main symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort. Angina can feel like pain, pressure, tightness, discomfort, squeezing, heaviness, or burning in the chest. It can be difficult to tell exactly where the pain is coming from. Angina pain usually starts behind the breastbone and grows more intense over a few minutes. The pain or discomfort can also be felt in areas far from the source of the pain, such as the shoulders, arms, neck, back, and jaw.
Aside from pain in the upper body, symptoms of angina may include:
Shortness of breath
Extreme tiredness
Light-headedness or fainting
Nausea, or feeling sick to the stomach
Heartburn or indigestion
Sweating
Weakness
It can be difficult to tell the difference between the symptoms of angina and of a
heart attack
.
Call 9-1-1
if you feel chest discomfort that does not go away with rest or medicine. Angina can also lead to a heart attack and other
complications
that can be life-threatening.","Symptoms of angina can be different for women and men. It is more common for women to feel angina pain in the arms, neck, back, and jaw — areas far from the source of the pain. Women also more often show other symptoms of angina aside from chest pain, such as shortness of breath, nausea, and light-headedness. Sometimes these are not recognized as symptoms of a heart condition. This can cause delays in
treatment
for women.","Your healthcare provider may diagnose angina based on your medical history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests and procedures. Tests can rule out other conditions and help determine whether you need medical attention right away.
Typically, healthcare providers ask about angina pain only when you have symptoms that you report during an office visit. Every few years, your provider may estimate your
chances of having heart disease
as part of your regular office visits.","Your healthcare provider will want to learn about your
symptoms
and
risk factors
, such as your personal and family health history, to determine whether your chest discomfort is due to angina or other causes. Be sure to mention any
heart disease risk factors
and other medical conditions you might have, including
diabetes
or
kidney disease
. Even if your chest pain is not angina, it can still be a symptom of a serious medical problem with your heart, blood vessels, chest muscles, lungs, or digestive system.
Tell your provider if you notice a pattern with your symptoms. Ask yourself these questions:
What does the pain or discomfort feel like?
Where do you feel it?
How long does it last?
How often does it occur?
How intense is it?
What brings it on, and what makes it better?","As part of a physical exam, your healthcare provider may measure your blood pressure and heart rate, feel your chest and belly, take your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse.","Depending on your symptoms and risk factors, your healthcare provider may want to run some tests to check for medical emergencies.
An
electrocardiogram (ECG)
can help recognize types of angina and other serious heart problems. Certain ECG patterns can be a sign of unstable angina or vasospastic angina. However, your ECG may sometimes be normal even if you have angina.
A
chest X-ray
is useful in screening for lung disorders and other causes of chest pain, such as
pneumonia
and
heart failure
. A chest X-ray alone is not enough to diagnose angina or coronary heart disease, but it can help rule out other causes of your symptoms.
Blood tests
can measure the level of cardiac
troponin
in your blood to help healthcare providers tell unstable angina from a heart attack. Troponin is a type of protein found in the heart muscles. When the heart muscles are damaged, troponin can leak into the bloodstream. Your provider may also check levels of other proteins, certain fats, cholesterol, and sugar in your blood.
To check how well your heart works, your provider may have you undergo some of the following
heart tests
as well.
An
echocardiogram
, or echo, can show how well your heart pumps blood to the rest of your body. An echo may help identify problems inside your heart, such as blood clots or
damaged heart valves
.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and other noninvasive tests can help check for problems with your heart’s movement or blood supply.
Stress testing
checks how well your heart works during exercise. A stress test can help confirm whether coronary heart disease is causing your angina symptoms.
Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography
looks at blood flow through your coronary arteries. This test can help confirm whether you have coronary heart disease.
Invasive coronary angiography
allows healthcare providers to study blood flow through your heart and coronary arteries closely. This test can help accurately identify coronary heart disease and determine whether surgery or other procedures might relieve your angina symptoms.
A
provocation test
can help diagnose vasospastic and microvascular angina. Your provider may use this test during invasive coronary angiography to see whether a chemical that causes angina symptoms can cause your coronary arteries to spasm."

Aortic Aneurysm,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/aortic-aneurysm,"Aortic aneurysms are balloon-like bulges that occur in the aorta, which carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. An aneurysm that bursts is a medical emergency.","An aortic aneurysm may not cause any symptoms. The types of symptoms you have will depend on the location of the aneurysm and whether it has become large enough to affect other parts of your body. If you do have symptoms of an aortic aneurysm, they may include:
Difficult or painful swallowing
if the aneurysm pushes on your esophagus, the tube that connects your mouth and your stomach
Difficulty breathing
if it pushes on your trachea, or windpipe
Feeling full
after not eating very much
Hoarseness
Pain
in the neck, jaw, back, chest, stomach area or shoulder, depending on where the aneurysm is located
A pulsating or throbbing
feeling in your stomach area
Shortness of breath
if the aneurysm presses on your lung
Swelling of the face, neck, or arms
if the aneurysm pushes on the superior vena cava, the main vein returning blood from your upper body to your heart
If you know you have an aortic aneurysm, it is important to know the symptoms of a rupture, or tear in the aorta, since quick treatment may save your life. Symptoms of a rupture may include:
Light-headedness
Rapid heart rate
Sudden, severe pain
in your stomach area, chest, or back",N/A,N/A,"To diagnose an aortic aneurysm, your healthcare provider will do a physical exam and an imaging test. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is diagnosed when your abdominal aorta is three centimeters or greater in diameter. The normal diameter of the thoracic aorta depends on your age, your sex, and which part of the thoracic aorta is measured.","During a physical exam, your provider may do a few basic steps to look for an aortic aneurysm.
Feel your stomach area.
Listen to your heart
for a heart murmur, softer heart sounds, or other changes in your blood flow that could be a sign of an aneurysm.
Check your pulse
in your arms and legs to see whether it feels weaker than normal.
Look for symptoms of medical conditions
that are risk factors for an aortic aneurysm, such as
Marfan
or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This may include looking at your skin, muscles and bones, eyes, head and face, and heart.","Screening for aortic aneurysm is usually done using ultrasound. This test shows if the diameter of your aorta is bigger than it should be. If it is larger than normal, your provider may recommend another screening later to check for growth.
To make the diagnosis your provider may order some tests.
Ultrasound
provides information about the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and monitors the aorta over time. If you have abdominal or back pain, an ultrasound can check for an abdominal aortic aneurysm or other possible causes of your pain. Once an aortic aneurysm is seen or suspected on ultrasound, you may have a CT scan or an MRI to provide more details about the shape or location of the aneurysm.
Echocardiography
provides information about the size of the aortic aneurysm and about the thoracic aorta, which is close to heart. Other parts of the thoracic aorta are better seen with other imaging studies such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MRI
provides information about the size, shape, and location of the aneurysm.","Certain groups of people may be screened for a thoracic aortic aneurysm. They include:
People who have Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, Ehlers–Danlos, or Turner syndrome
Parents, children, and siblings (first-degree relatives) of people who have a thoracic aortic aneurysm or a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)-associated thoracic aortic aneurysm"

Arrhythmias,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/arrhythmias,"An arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm.","An arrhythmia may not cause any obvious symptoms. You may notice symptoms such as a slow or irregular heartbeat or notice pauses between heartbeats. You may also feel like your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast. These are called heart palpitations.
Other symptoms of arrhythmias include:
Anxiety
Chest pain or discomfort
Confusion
Difficulty breathing, or gasping during sleep
Dizziness and fainting
Tiredness or weakness
Keep track of when and how often you have symptoms, what you feel, what you were doing, and whether these things change over time. If your symptoms are very serious, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain, seek emergency medical care.",N/A,N/A,"Sometimes, especially if you do not have any noticeable
symptoms
of an arrhythmia, your doctor may find out you have one during a routine screening or physical for a competitive sport.
To diagnose an arrhythmia, your doctor will ask you about any symptoms, lifestyle habits, and other
risk factors
of arrhythmias. Your doctor will also do a physical exam, which may include these steps:
Checking for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure
Checking your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating
Listening to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat
Listening to your heart for a heart murmur
Looking for signs of other diseases, such as thyroid disease, that could be causing arrhythmias
If you or your child has a high risk of arrhythmias, your doctor may screen you regularly with heart tests. These tests, described in the next section, can help your doctor check whether your heartbeat is too fast, too slow, or irregular, even if you do not have any symptoms. Some of these tests may look at the heart’s structure and function or may determine if you have risk factors for developing an arrhythmia.","An
electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG)
is the most common test for diagnosing arrhythmias. An EKG records your heart’s electrical activity. Your doctor may do an EKG during a stress test, which records your heart’s activity when it is working hard and beating fast.
Your doctor may also do other tests to diagnose arrhythmias.
Blood tests
measure the level of certain substances in the blood, such as potassium or other electrolytes and thyroid hormone.
Monitors for long-term recording
include Holter monitors and implantable loop recorders. These record your heart rhythm while you do your normal activities. Holter monitors measure your heart rhythm using a device that is outside of your body and are usually used for short periods of time. For an implantable loop recorder, your doctor will place the device under your skin. The recorder transmits data to your doctor’s office. Implantable loop recorders may be worn for longer periods of time and may help your doctor figure out why you are having palpitations or fainting spells, especially if these symptoms do not happen very often.
An electrophysiology study (EPS),
which is performed by an EPS cardiologist, measures the electrical activity of your heart. The doctor threads a wire through a blood vessel to your heart. The wire electrically stimulates your heart and triggers any underlying arrhythmia if you have one. If you have another condition that may raise your risk, an EPS can help your doctor find out your risk of developing arrhythmias. An EPS also allows your doctor to test whether a treatment, such as medicine, will stop the problem.
Tilt table testing
may help find the cause of fainting spells. You lie on a table that moves from a lying-down position to an upright position. The change in position may cause you to faint. Your doctor watches your symptoms, heart rate, EKG reading, and blood pressure throughout the test.
Genetic testing
can check whether you have a type of arrhythmia that is caused by specific
Genes
. This test is important when one or more of your close relatives has an arrhythmia caused by the same gene or had
cardiac arrest
.
Heart imaging tests
,
such as computed tomography (CT) scans or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may check the structure of your heart chambers, show how well your heart is working, look for evidence of scar tissue in your heart muscle, or sometimes may look at your heart arteries.",N/A,N/A
Asthma,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/asthma,Asthma is a long-term condition in which the airways become inflamed and narrowed at times. This makes it hard to breathe.,"Symptoms
of asthma may include:
Wheezing,
which is a whistling sound when you breathe out
Coughing,
especially at night or early morning
Shortness of breath
Chest tightness
Asthma is a chronic condition that makes it harder to breathe. Learn how asthma affects the lungs and about common symptoms with this animated video. Asthma can be managed. If you have asthma, talk to a healthcare provider about making an asthma action plan.
Other conditions can cause these symptoms. But in asthma, the symptoms often follow a pattern:
They come and go over time or within the same day.
They start or get worse with viral infections, such as a cold.
They are triggered by exercise, allergies, cold air, or breathing too fast from laughing or crying.
They are worse at night or in the morning.
Asthma symptoms in young children
may look different than symptoms in others. It is also possible for symptoms to change as you get older. Watch out for these
signs
that your asthma might be getting worse:
You have symptoms
more often than usual, or they feel worse.
You need your reliever medicine
more often than usual.
You wake up at night
because of coughing or other asthma symptoms.
You have trouble with usual activities,
including exercise, because of your asthma.",N/A,N/A,"Talk to your healthcare provider if you or your child have asthma

View the fact sheet","Your healthcare provider may want to run some tests to diagnose your asthma.
Lung function tests
Lung function tests
measure how well you can breathe in and out:
Spirometry
measures how much air you breathe out and how fast. Some people feel lightheaded or tired from the breathing effort for this test.
Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests
measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. The test can be done during spirometry or with a small handheld device.
Bronchodilator responsiveness tests
measure how much better you can blow air after inhaling a fast-acting bronchodilator, a medicine that helps open your airways by relaxing the muscles around them. The test compares your spirometry or PEF results before and after the medicine.
Challenge tests
Challenge tests, also called bronchial provocation tests, assess how sensitive your airways are. These tests compare how fast you can blow air before and after a challenge agent. Challenge agents are substances or activities that may tighten the muscles in your airways if they become irritated from being too sensitive, including:
Inhaled medicines
such as methacholine, mannitol, or histamine
Allergens
or irritants that cause no reaction in people who do not have asthma
Exercise,
which cools and dries the airways
Hyperventilation,
or breathing in short, quick breaths
Other diagnostic tests
Your healthcare provider may want to run other tests to help diagnose your asthma. Some of them can also assess your risk of asthma flare-ups and predict how well you will respond to medicine:
Allergy tests
can find which allergens, such as pet dander or pollen, cause a reaction in your body when you are around them. Your provider may run these tests if you have a history of allergies.
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests
measure how much nitric oxide is in your breath. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your airways are inflamed, which can make it hard to breathe. This test does not require heavy breathing and has few risks.
Blood tests
can measure levels of
white blood cells
, which can indicate inflammation. Blood tests can also help find your allergies.
A
chest CT scan
may show whether the walls of your airways are thicker.
Most diagnostic tests for asthma do not work well for young children. This can make it difficult to diagnose
asthma in children

Atherosclerosis,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries. This causes the arteries to narrow and can reduce blood flow through the body.,"Early stages of atherosclerosis often do not cause symptoms. Symptoms may first appear when you are under physical or emotional stress — times when the body needs more
oxygen
.
Some people may not notice symptoms until
plaque
buildup causes serious problems. It is important to see your healthcare provider often to check for plaque buildup early.
Atherosclerosis reduces the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the tissues and organs of the body. Symptoms can lower your quality of life or lead to death.","Symptoms depend on which
arteries
are affected and how much blood flow is blocked. You may not notice symptoms until plaque buildup causes severe problems. Some conditions caused by atherosclerosis and their symptoms include the following:
Coronary heart disease
includes symptoms of chest pain (
angina
), heart palpitations (feeling that your heart is racing), shortness of breath, cold sweats, dizziness, extreme tiredness and weakness, and nausea. Coronary heart disease results from atherosclerosis of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.
Peripheral artery disease
includes symptoms of pain, aching, heaviness, or cramps in your legs while walking or climbing stairs. Pain and other symptoms that stop when you rest is called intermittent claudication. The pain is often in the calf, but you may also feel it in your buttocks, thigh, or foot. Some people with PAD have different symptoms or no symptoms at all.
Vertebral artery disease
includes problems with thinking and memory, weakness or numbness on one side of the body or face, and vision trouble
.
Transient ischemic attack
(TIA), commonly called a ministroke, is a more serious symptom.
Mesenteric artery
ischemia
of the intestines includes severe belly pain following meals, weight loss, and diarrhea.
Erectile dysfunction (ED)
is an early warning sign that a man may be at higher risk for atherosclerosis and its complications. If you have ED, talk with your healthcare team about your risk of plaque buildup.
You may not notice other symptoms until plaque buildup causes serious problems. Seeing your doctor regularly is important, as they may be able to find plaque buildup before it gets serious. For example:
Carotid artery disease:
Plaque builds up in the arteries of the neck. In early stages, you may not have any symptoms. Your provider may be able to hear a whooshing sound called a bruit when listening to the blood flow in your neck using a stethoscope. Often people do not know they have carotid artery disease until they have a
transient ischemic attack
or a
stroke
.
Renal artery stenosis
: Using a stethoscope, your provider may hear an abnormal sound, or bruit, in your belly, which is an early sign of renal artery stenosis. This condition results from plaque buildup in the arteries that deliver blood to the kidneys. As the disease worsens, it can cause pressure, extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, feeling sick to the stomach, swelling in the hands or feet, changes in how often you need to urinate, and itchiness or numbness.
Talk to your provider about your symptoms and whether you have
risk factors
of atherosclerosis.",N/A,"Beginning at age 20, your provider will regularly check to see if you have
risk factors
for
plaque
buildup in the
arteries

Check your blood pressure.
Calculate your
body mass index
by measuring your waist.
Order blood tests
to see whether you have unhealthy
blood cholesterol
or
triglycerides
.
Very
high blood pressure
is a medical emergency. If the top number of your blood pressure is higher than 180 mm Hg or if the bottom number is higher than 120 mm Hg, call your healthcare provider right away.","Talk with your provider about risk factors related to:
Your lifestyle habits
such as smoking or vaping, low physical activity, and unhealthy eating behaviors

diabetes
and
inflammatory
conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis
and psoriasis
Your family history
if you have blood relatives who had
heart attacks
or
died suddenly
before they were 55 years old
A
risk estimator
can help determine your risk for a major complication, such as a heart attack, from atherosclerosis.
For people between ages 20 and 59, the risk estimator can help you understand the risk of having a stroke or heart attack over your lifetime.
If you are between ages 40 and 79, the risk estimator can help you understand the risk of having a stroke or heart attack in the next 10 years.
The risk estimator considers your
cholesterol
levels, blood pressure, and other factors to calculate your 10-year or lifetime risk of a serious complication from atherosclerosis. If you have all the information, you can use the app yourself. The app shows risk levels as low, borderline, intermediate, or high.
Discussing risk with your provider
Keep in mind that your cholesterol numbers and your risk score are only part of the story. Talk to your provider to learn what the numbers mean for you. Other risk estimators are available, such as the
ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus
. It's good to have the options, because no single risk calculator is right for everyone. Studies show that some calculators overestimate risk for certain groups, while others may underestimate risk.","When diagnosing your condition, your provider may order tests even if you don't show
symptoms
. The type of test depends on which
arteries
are affected by plaque buildup.
Blood tests
Providers use blood tests to check cholesterol,
triglycerides
, blood sugar, and
lipoprotein
levels, along with proteins that show signs of
inflammation
, such as C-reactive protein.
Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. An ECG can show how fast your heart is beating, check your heart's rhythm, and assess the electrical impulses passing through each part of your heart.
For an ECG, you will lie on a table. A provider will attach up to 12 electrodes to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. The electrodes are connected by wires to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity. The test takes a few minutes. An ECG has no serious risks.
Imaging tests
Your provider may order a
heart imaging test
to take pictures of your heart and check the blood flow in your heart and coronary arteries.
Different heart imaging tests can be used to diagnose atherosclerosis:
Angiography
is a special type of X-ray using a dye. This procedure can check the arteries in the heart, neck, brain, or other areas of the body.
Cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
detects tissue damage or problems with blood flow in the heart or coronary arteries. Cardiac MRI can help explain results from other imaging tests such as chest X-rays and CT scans.
Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) scanning
assesses blood flow through the small blood vessels of the heart. This type of heart scan can diagnose
coronary microvascular disease
.
Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography
shows the inside of your coronary arteries without
invasive cardiac catheterization
. It uses radiation to create a picture of your heart's arteries. Because CT scans use radiation, talk to your provider before the test if you are or could possibly be pregnant.
Cardiac intravascular ultrasonography
uses a tiny
ultrasound
device on the tip of a
cardiac catheter
to look inside the arteries of the heart.
Learn more about this procedure
.
Coronary calcium scans
measure the amount of calcium in the walls of your coronary arteries using a CT scanner. Buildup of calcium is a sign of atherosclerosis. The results are given as a score based on the amount of calcium in your coronary arteries. A score of zero is normal. The higher your score, the more likely you are to have coronary heart disease. If your score is high, talk with your provider about more testing and ways that
heart-healthy living
can lower your risk of complications.
Stress tests
A
stress test
checks how your heart responds to physical stress. Some heart problems are easier to detect when your heart is pumping blood to your body at a high rate.
You may do a stress test in a clinic, a provider's office, or a hospital. The test usually involves exercise such as walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike. If you are not able to exercise, your provider will give you medicine to make your heart work hard and beat faster, as if you were exercising.
Ankle-brachial index (ABI) test
An ABI test can help diagnose
peripheral artery disease
. This painless test compares the blood pressures in your ankle and your arm using a blood pressure cuff and an ultrasound device.
The illustration shows the ankle-brachial index test. The test compares blood pressure in the ankle with blood pressure in the arm. As the blood pressure cuff deflates, the blood pressure in the arteries is recorded.","Healthcare providers sometimes recommend
genetic
testing for people who have very high cholesterol levels or if they have a family history of heart disease or unexplained, sudden death at young ages. For example,
familial hypercholesterolemia
can be passed from parent to child and raises the risk for severe complications of atherosclerosis at a young age.
If results of genetic testing show you have a high risk of disease linked to atherosclerosis, you and your provider can discuss plans for monitoring your heart health,
heart-healthy living
, and starting
treatment
with medicines. Your provider may also recommend genetic counseling to help you understand your results.

blood tests
.
Screening tests
Screening tests can help determine if your blood is clotting properly.
A complete blood count (CBC)
measures many different parts of your blood, such as red, white blood cells and platelets. If the number of platelets in your blood is low, you may have a
platelet disorder
instead of a clotting factor disorder.
A partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test,
also called an activated PTT (aPTT), measures how long it takes blood to clot. It can help determine whether there is a problem with a certain group of clotting factors.
A prothrombin time (PT) test
also measures how long it takes blood to clot. It can help identify problems with a different group of clotting factors than the PTT test.
A mixing test
can help determine whether the problem is in the clotting factors or is caused by antibodies blocking the clotting factors, such as with autoimmune disorders or acquired hemophilia.
Clotting factor tests
To determine which bleeding disorder you have, your healthcare provider may order clotting factor tests, also called factor assays or a coagulation panel. A clotting factor test measures the level or the activity of a specific clotting factor in your blood.
Von Willebrand factor (vWF) tests
measure the amount of vWF in your blood and how well it works to determine which type of VWD you have.
Clotting factor VIII tests
measure the activity of factor VIII in your blood. If you have very low levels of clotting factor VIII, you may have hemophilia A. The assay can also assess how serious your factor deficiency is, which may help determine what treatment you need.
A Bethesda test
looks for antibodies that may be blocking factor VIII or IX.
Factor XIII antigen and activity assays
assess factor XIII deficiency.
Genetic testing
helps determine whether particular genes may be causing the bleeding disorder. Your provider may refer you or your child to a specialist in genetic testing."

Lipoprotein (lipid) panel
A lipoprotein panel, also called a lipid panel or lipid profile, measures the levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol and
triglycerides
in your blood. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are higher than normal may be signs of higher risk of coronary heart disease.
A lipoprotein panel gives the following types of information:
Total cholesterol
LDL (“bad”) cholesterol,
which is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the
arteries
HDL (“good”) cholesterol,
which helps decrease cholesterol blockages in the arteries
Triglycerides
, which are another type of fat in your blood
Your lipoprotein panel may also provide other potentially useful numbers, such as your non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) and remnant LDL (total cholesterol minus LDL and HDL cholesterol).
The goal for a healthy lipid profile is to have non-HDL levels below 130 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) with an HDL of at least 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women. Check with your provider on the lipid levels that are best for you.

For healthy persons, how often you get a lipid panel done depends on your age, risk factors, and family history of high blood cholesterol or cardiovascular diseases, such as
atherosclerosis
,
heart attack,
or
stroke
.
Here is a general guide:
Ages 19 or younger:
Screening begins at ages 9 to 11 and should be repeated every 5 years. Screening may be performed as early as age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke.
Ages 20 to 65:
Younger adults should be screened every 5 years. Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should be screened every 1 to 2 years.
Older than 65:
Older adults should be screened every year.
Lipoprotein-a
A lipoprotein-a, or Lp(a), test is not usually part of a routine lipid panel. High levels of Lp(a) may mean you are at higher risk of heart or blood vessel diseases, even if your other cholesterol levels are healthy. The
genes
you
inherit
from your parents determine how much Lp(a) you have. Your Lp(a) level is unlikely to change much from childhood to old age.
Your healthcare provider may order an Lp(a) test if you have a
family history
of stroke, early heart disease, such as a heart attack, or do not know your family medical history. If you have a high Lp(a) level, your provider may prescribe
statins
, a medicine to help lower your heart disease risk, even if your other cholesterol levels are in the healthy range.

heart imaging test
called an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) will show a severe ventricular
arrythmia
or no heartbeat at all. These are all
symptoms
of cardiac arrest.
Sometimes a person is in the hospital when cardiac arrest occurs. Medical monitoring can alert hospital staff to abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems.
Most often, cardiac arrest is diagnosed after it occurs. Healthcare providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person’s collapse.","After you have a cardiac arrest, first responders will ask witnesses what they saw. The emergency room doctor will do a physical exam and check your medical history and your family history. The doctor will also order tests to assess your condition.

Cardiogenic shock may start with symptoms such as confusion or rapid breathing, or a person may have no symptoms and then suddenly lose consciousness.
The most common signs of cardiogenic shock are:
Low blood pressure
, which can make you feel dizzy, confused, and nauseous
Weak or irregular pulse
Symptoms of cardiogenic shock may include:
Breathing problems, including fast breathing and severe shortness of breath
Bulging
veins
in the neck
Clammy skin
Cold hands and feet
Fever
Loss of consciousness
Swelling of feet
Urinating much less than usual or not at all
Cardiac arrest
Many of these symptoms develop because the heart does not deliver enough blood to the body’s tissues and organs. For example, as blood pressure drops during cardiogenic shock, the body tries to compensate by limiting blood flow to the hands and feet, causing them to cool down.
As blood flow to the brain drops, the person may become confused or lose consciousness. The kidneys may shut down, producing less urine. Reduced blood flow in the lungs may lead to fluid buildup there, making it hard to breathe.

Measure your blood pressure.
Low blood pressure that does not return to normal on its own is a sign of cardiogenic shock.","Your doctor may order one or more of the following tests and procedures to diagnose cardiogenic shock.
Chest X-ray
A chest X-ray is a fast and painless imaging test to look at the structures in and around your chest.
This test can help diagnose and check conditions such as pneumonia, heart failure, lung cancer, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and lung tissue scarring, called fibrosis. Doctors may use chest X-rays to see how well certain treatments are working and to check for complications after certain procedures or surgeries.
The test may be done in the doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. You will stand, sit, or lie still for the test.
Chest X-rays have few risks. The amount of radiation used in a chest X-ray is very small. Talk to your provider if you are or could be pregnant.
Coronary angiography
Coronary angiography is a procedure that uses contrast dye, usually containing iodine, and X-ray pictures to detect blockages in the coronary arteries that are caused by plaque buildup. Blockages prevent your heart from getting oxygen and important nutrients.
This procedure is used to diagnose heart diseases or after abnormal results from tests such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or an exercise stress test. If you are having a heart attack, coronary angiography can help your doctors plan your treatment.
Coronary angiography is often done in a hospital. You will stay awake, but you will get medicine to relax you during the procedure. Often, coronary angiography is done with a cardiac catheterization procedure. For this, your doctor will clean and numb an area on the arm, groin or upper thigh, or neck before making a small hole in a blood vessel. Your doctor will insert a catheter tube into your blood vessel. Your doctor will take X-ray pictures to help place the catheter in your coronary artery. After the catheter is in place, your doctor will inject the contrast dye through the catheter to highlight blockages and will take X-ray pictures of your heart. If blockages are detected, your doctor may use percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, to improve blood flow to your heart.
After coronary angiography, your doctor will remove the catheter and close and bandage the opening on your arm, groin, or neck. You may develop a bruise and soreness where the catheter was inserted. You will stay in the hospital for a few hours or overnight. During this time, your healthcare team will check your heart rate and blood pressure.
Coronary angiography is a common procedure that rarely causes serious problems. However, as with any procedure involving the heart, there is some risk. These risks include bleeding, allergic reactions to the contrast dye, infection, blood vessel damage, arrhythmias, and blood clots that can trigger a heart attack or stroke. The risk of complications is higher in people who are older or who have chronic kidney disease or diabetes.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart is pumping blood. A type of echo called Doppler ultrasound shows how well blood flows through your heart's chambers and valves.
The illustration shows a patient having echocardiography. The patient lies on his left side. A sonographer moves the transducer on the patient’s chest, while viewing the echo pictures on a computer.
Echo can detect blood clots inside your heart, fluid buildup in the pericardium (the sac around the heart), tumors, and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your body. Echo also can help your doctor find the cause of abnormal heart sounds, such as heart murmurs. Your doctor also might use echo to see how well your heart responds to certain heart treatments.
Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG)
An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart’s electrical activity. An EKG can show how fast your heart is beating, whether the rhythm of your heartbeats is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses passing through each part of your heart. You may have an EKG as part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease.
An EKG may be recorded in a doctor’s office, an outpatient facility, in a hospital before major surgery, or as part of stress testing. For the test, you will lie still on a table. A nurse or technician will attach up to 12 electrodes to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Your skin may need to be shaved to help the electrodes stick. The electrodes are connected by wires to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity on graph paper or on a computer. After the test, the electrodes will be removed.
An EKG has no serious risks. EKGs don’t give off electrical charges such as shocks. You may develop a slight rash where the electrodes were attached to your skin. This rash usually goes away on its own without treatment.
Other tests may give your doctor important information.

Earlier diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in quality of life for people who have COPD.
Common symptoms of COPD include:
Shortness of breath,
especially with physical activity. You may feel like breathing takes more effort or that you are gasping for air.
An ongoing cough
or a cough that produces a lot of
mucus
, sometimes called a smoker’s cough. This is often the first symptom of COPD.
Wheezing or a whistling
or squeaky sound when you breathe.
Chest tightness or heaviness
, which may make it hard to take a deep breath or make it painful to breathe.
Fatigue
or extreme tiredness.
Not everyone who has these symptoms has COPD. Likewise, not everyone with COPD has all these symptoms. Your healthcare provider can determine whether you have COPD. You may also have additional conditions that need to be diagnosed and treated. It is very common for people with COPD to have other conditions, including heart disease.
If your symptoms are mild, you may adjust your lifestyle to make breathing easier. For example, you may take the elevator instead of the stairs. For more serious symptoms, such as becoming short of breath during physical work, your healthcare provider can provide treatments and other ways to help. Severe COPD can cause additional symptoms, such as lack of appetite, loss of weight and muscle, anxiety, and depression.

With a flare-up, you have a harder time breathing. You may also have chest tightness or a fever. You may need to cough or clear your throat more. Or you might find yourself coughing up yellow or green phlegm.
Call your healthcare provider right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. Your provider may prescribe antibiotics to treat an infection. They may also give you other medicines, such as bronchodilators and inhaled or oral steroids, to help you breathe. Serious symptoms may require treatment in a hospital.
How serious a flare-up is depends on the amount of lung damage you have. Poor sleep can also increase the risk of a flare-up. Take
steps to keep yourself healthy

How Does A COPD Diagnosis Affect Your Loved Ones?
Learn what a COPD diagnosis means for your family, why it’s important for caregivers to take care of themselves, and how other family members can be supportive.
Discuss your smoking habits
or whether you have had contact with secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust.
If you have persistent shortness of breath that gets worse over time,
let your provider know, because this is the main symptom of COPD.
If you have an ongoing cough,
tell them how long you’ve had it, how much you cough, and how much

Lung function and imaging tests
will tell whether you have COPD and how serious it is.
If your provider recommends getting an X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan
to detect lung cancer or diagnose a breathing problem, ask them about your risk of COPD.
If you get a COPD diagnosis, ask about
genetic
screening.
Some people have a genetic condition that increases their risk of COPD, called
alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency
. Screening is especially important if you have family members with AAT deficiency or who were diagnosed with COPD in their 40s or 50s or have liver disease. Likewise, if you are the first in your family to learn that AAT deficiency is part of your genetic makeup, ask your provider for advice on talking with family members about your results.","Diagnosing COPD
Learn about spirometry and other diagnostic tests your provider may use to diagnose COPD based on your symptoms and risk factors.
The main test for COPD is spirometry. It can detect COPD before
symptoms
are recognized. Your provider may also use the test results to find out how serious your COPD is and help set your
treatment
goals.
Spirometry is a lung function test that measures how much air you breathe out and how fast you can blow air out.
During the test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then you will blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. Your healthcare team may have you inhale (breathe in) medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. They can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine.
Learn more about
spirometry tests
.","Peak expiratory flow test
This test measures how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. This test can be done during spirometry or with a small handheld device.
Arterial blood gas test
An arterial blood gas test measures the
oxygen
and carbon dioxide levels in your blood.
Arterial blood gas tests are usually done in a hospital but may be done in a healthcare provider’s office. For this test, blood will be taken from an
artery
, usually in the wrist where your pulse is measured.

lung function tests
.","Chest X-ray
A chest
X-ray
is a fast and painless imaging test that looks at the structures in and around your chest.
The test cannot diagnose COPD, but it can be used to find other conditions that may interact with COPD. The test may be done in a healthcare provider’s office, clinic, or hospital. You will stand, sit, or lie still for the test.
Chest X-rays have few risks. The amount of radiation used in a chest X-ray is very small. Talk to your provider if you are or could be pregnant.
Chest computed tomography (CT) scan
A CT scan is a painless imaging test that takes many detailed pictures of your lungs and the inside of your chest. Computers can combine these pictures to create three-dimensional models that show the size, shape, and position of your lungs and structures in your chest.
A chest CT scan can help find the cause of lung symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain. It can also tell your healthcare provider whether you have certain lung problems, such as a tumor, excess fluid around the lungs known as pleural
effusion
, or pneumonia.
Your chest CT scan may be done in a medical imaging facility or hospital. You will lie still on a table that will slide into the scanner. You will hear soft buzzing or clicking sounds when you are inside the scanner and the scanner is taking pictures. You will be able to hear from and talk to the technician performing the test while you are inside the scanner. For some diagnoses, a contrast dye, often iodine-based, may be injected into a
vein
in your arm before the imaging test.
In rare instances, some people have an allergic reaction to contrast dye. There is also a slight risk of cancer, particularly in growing children, because the test uses radiation. Although the amount of radiation from one test is usually less than the amount of radiation you are naturally exposed to over three years, patients should not receive more CT scans than what is recommended by clinical guidelines.

Results of screening and diagnostic tests can help you and your provider work together to improve your heart health.","You may not have any symptoms until you have a serious health problem, such as a
heart attack
or
cardiac arrest
. Regular checkups allow you to talk with your healthcare provider about your risk and how to prevent heart disease. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes can also help.
You should start getting screening tests and risk assessments for coronary heart disease around age 20 if you do not have any of the risk factors. Children with risk factors such as obesity, low levels of physical activity, or a family history of heart problems, may need screening.
To screen for coronary heart disease, your provider may:
Assess your risk factors
to help evaluate your chances of developing coronary heart disease
Calculate your
body mass index
and waist circumference to help determine whether you have overweight or obesity
Check your
blood pressure

Screening usually happens in a provider’s office, but sometimes screenings are offered at health fairs, drugstores, or other places. Blood samples might be collected at a provider’s office, hospital, or laboratory. Ask whether you need to fast (not eat or drink anything besides water) before the blood tests.","Your healthcare provider may use a risk calculator to estimate your cardiovascular risk score. Risk scores indicate the chances of having a heart attack, having a stroke, or dying from heart disease in the next 10 years or more.
Risk assessments should be repeated every four to six years in adults who do not have heart disease.
What does a risk score mean?
A risk score uses data from many people who have similar risk factors. Even if a risk calculator says your risk score is high, it does not mean that something bad will happen. For example, a 10-year risk score of 15% means that, on average, 15 out of 100 people in that risk category will have a heart problem within 10 years.
Risk calculators can give you and your healthcare provider good information about your risk. But your provider may consider other factors to estimate your risk more accurately. There are several different risk calculators, and no single risk calculator is right for everyone.
The
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Estimator Plus
app uses your
cholesterol
levels, age, sex, race, and blood pressure to assess risk. It also considers whether you smoke or take medicines to manage your high blood pressure or blood cholesterol. The app is for people between ages 20 and 79 who have not had a heart problem. For details on the app, read pages eight and nine in our booklet,
Your Guide to Lowering Your Cholesterol with Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC

To help diagnose coronary heart disease, your provider may also order some of the following
heart tests
:
An
electrocardiogram
(ECG)
records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart and determines whether the heart's rhythm is steady or irregular.
A
coronary calcium scan
measures the amount of calcium in the walls of your coronary arteries. This test is a type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan. Coronary calcium scans can also help assess coronary heart disease risk for people who smoke or who do not have heart disease symptoms.
Stress tests
check your heart while it is working hard and beating quickly. For stress testing, you walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike. If you have a medical problem that prevents you from exercising, your provider may give you medicine to make your heart work harder for a short time. To check for low blood flow to your heart muscle, your provider will use an ECG or another imaging test. An ECG will monitor your heart's electrical activity while you exercise.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)
detects tissue damage or problems with blood flow in the heart or coronary arteries. It can help your provider diagnose disease in the small coronary arteries, known as microvascular disease, as well as nonobstructive or obstructive coronary artery disease. A cardiac MRI can also help explain results from other imaging tests.
A cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) scan
assesses blood flow through the coronary blood vessels and into the heart muscle. This type of
nuclear imaging test
can help diagnose coronary microvascular disease.
Coronary CT angiography

Pulmonary
exacerbation
involves a worsening of lung symptoms, such as more coughing or wheezing, chest congestion, and a change in mucus color. You may also have weight loss, a poor appetite, or fever.
Coughing or spitting up blood
may be a sign that an artery has broken and is bleeding into the airway.
Sudden shortness of breath or chest pain
may be a sign of a pneumothorax, or collapsed lung.","Diagnosing cystic fibrosis takes several steps. Your healthcare provider may diagnose cystic fibrosis based on your
symptoms
and the results of
genetic
and sweat chloride tests.
It is important to diagnose cystic fibrosis as early as possible. Newborn screening makes it possible to detect the disease early in life. Early treatment helps prevent
complications
and can improve survival.","All newborns in the United States are tested for cystic fibrosis.
Newborn screening
identifies more than half of cystic fibrosis cases. However, many people born before 2010 have not been screened.
Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis is performed during a baby’s first two to three days of life. A few drops of blood from a heel prick are placed on a special card and tested by a lab. The test will cause your baby brief discomfort.
The blood test checks for levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), a chemical made by the pancreas. In people who have cystic fibrosis, IRT tends to be high. However, most babies with high levels of IRT do not have cystic fibrosis. IRT can also be high if the baby was born
preterm
(premature), had a stressful birth, or is a carrier of cystic fibrosis.
If IRT is high, then the hospital will likely test the baby’s DNA for some of the
CFTR
mutations that cause cystic fibrosis. The set of mutations in these tests varies by state. After a positive screening test, a diagnosis is confirmed with more tests.
Screening tests for
CFTR
mutations sometimes miss cases of cystic fibrosis in babies who have Asian or African ancestry. That is because these babies have rarer
CFTR
mutations that are not tested for.","Genetic testing can tell you whether you are a carrier of a
mutated
CFTR
gene. This is called carrier screening. Genetic testing looks at your DNA from a blood or saliva sample or cells from the inside of your cheek. It is your choice whether to have this test.
People who inherit a mutation of the
CFTR
gene from one parent are cystic fibrosis carriers. People who have inherited a mutation of the
CFTR
gene from both parents will have cystic fibrosis.
Learn more about how cystic fibrosis is inherited
.
In previous years, the standard test to check for cystic fibrosis carriers looked for 23 or more of the most common disease-causing gene mutations. This test is more likely to miss carriers who have Asian or African ancestry. Now, many tests look for more
CFTR
mutations, but there is still a small chance that you could carry a type of mutation that did not show up on the test.
Siblings (brothers and sisters) of a person who has cystic fibrosis may want to be tested for cystic fibrosis even if they do not have symptoms. Other family members, such as first cousins and half siblings, may be tested if they have symptoms or if the family is concerned that those individuals might have cystic fibrosis or be carriers.
After a positive or unclear screening test result, the diagnosis should be confirmed with further testing. A genetic counselor can help you understand the meaning of your carrier screening result.","Couples who are planning to have children may want to be tested to see whether they are cystic fibrosis carriers. Getting tested before pregnancy gives you more options and time to make decisions if results show that both parents are carriers.
The tests use a sample of blood, saliva, or cells from inside your cheek to check your DNA. It is your choice whether to have this screening. Talk with your healthcare provider about screening if you’re thinking about getting pregnant or if you’re already pregnant.
Often the mother is tested first. If the father has a family history of cystic fibrosis, he may be tested first. If one parent is a carrier for a
CFTR
gene mutation, then the next step is to test the other parent.
If you are already pregnant, both parents may be tested at the same time. If you are both cystic fibrosis carriers, then prenatal testing can check if the unborn baby has two mutated
CFTR
genes."

Heart Inflammation,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart-inflammation,"Heart inflammation is your body’s natural reaction to an infection or injury to the heart, and it can cause serious health problems. The three main types of heart inflammation are endocarditis, pericarditis, and myocarditis.","The symptoms of heart inflammation can occur suddenly or progress slowly. You may have severe symptoms or almost no symptoms.
If a virus causes your heart inflammation, you may have a cough, runny nose, or gastrointestinal symptoms a few weeks before you notice any other symptoms of heart inflammation.
Some symptoms of heart inflammation may feel like the flu and go away on their own after a few weeks. Other symptoms include chest pain or shortness of breath.
There are several common symptoms for each type of heart inflammation.","Fever and chills
New or worsening heart murmur, or abnormal heart sounds","Chest pain and discomfort
The feeling of a racing or pounding heart","Because
symptoms
vary by type and from one person to the next, heart inflammation may be hard to diagnose. Your healthcare provider may do a physical exam and order tests.","To help diagnose heart inflammation, your healthcare provider may ask some basic questions.
Have you had endocarditis, myocarditis, or pericarditis in the past?
Have you had a recent illness or injury to the chest?
Have you had any symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
Do you have any other medical conditions or
risk factors
for heart inflammation, including exposure to certain medicines or toxins or a travel history that may be significant?
They may also examine you and do one or more of the following:
Check your legs for swelling, a sign of heart failure
Check your skin for any changes that endocarditis can cause
Check your temperature for fever
Check for a spleen that is larger than normal due to an infection or for abdominal pain, which can be a symptom of endocarditis
Listen to your heart for a new murmur that may be heard with endocarditis, a pericardial friction rub (a grating sound) that may be heard with pericarditis, or a heart rhythm that is not normal
Listen to your lungs
Perform an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) to measure electrical signals from your heart and your heart rhythm.","Your healthcare provider may need to do imaging tests or procedures to look at your heart.
Heart imaging tests
take pictures of your heart, arteries or other blood vessels to help your provider see whether there are any problems.
A chest X-ray
shows a picture of your heart, lungs, and bones.
An echocardiogram
uses sound waves (ultrasound) to make pictures of your heart.
Cardiac MRI
uses a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine to take detailed pictures of your heart.
Endomyocardial
biopsy
(EMB)
tests very small pieces of the heart to look for myocarditis.
Heart valve tissue testing
finds tiny germs, microbes, or growths that may cause endocarditis.
Pericardiocentesis
removes extra fluid in the pericardium. Your healthcare provider will insert a flexible tube called a catheter or a needle into the chest wall to remove the fluid. They will look at the fluid for bacteria, signs of cancer, or other causes of pericarditis.","Blood tests
may help your healthcare provider find the cause of your heart inflammation.
Blood cultures
may identify the bacterium, virus, or fungus that is causing endocarditis or pericarditis.
Cardiac troponins or creatine kinase-MB
are blood markers that increase when there is damage to your heart. Since there are no specific blood tests for myocarditis, these markers can be a sign of injury to the heart muscle. However, they also increase with heart attack or other injury and do not necessarily mean you have myocarditis. These markers are often normal in cases of subacute or
chronic
myocarditis.
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
may indicate
inflammation
in the body if higher than normal.
A complete blood count (CBC)
looks for higher levels of white blood cells, which might indicate infection.
Serum cardiac autoantibodies (AAbs)
are substances that your body can make if you have an
autoimmune
disease. These
antibody
can attack your heart muscle.
Your provider may also test for organisms that can cause Lyme disease, tuberculosis, HIV, or hepatitis C."

Heart Valve Diseases,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart-valve-diseases,Heart valve diseases are problems affecting one or more of the four valves in the heart.,"Symptoms can vary based on the
type
of heart valve disease. Symptoms in newborns are also different from symptoms in adults. Some symptoms are related to heart failure, which can be caused by problems with the heart valves.","Signs of a heart valve condition may be present at birth. They can be seen as symptoms or may be detected during a
newborn screening
. Sometimes, signs of a heart valve defect may not appear until weeks or even months after birth.
Symptoms can include:
Not gaining weight or growing as they should
: You may notice problems eating. Some children may get sweaty from the effort of eating.
Blue skin tone,
especially the lips, fingers, and toes
Low levels of oxygen in the blood:
Your doctor may find this using a pulse oximetry screening test.
Pale skin, rapid pulse or breathing, or cool, clammy hands:
These are signs of shock, which is a medical emergency in newborns.
Weak pulse","Symptoms of heart valve diseases that occur with older age may happen slowly. Many people mistake early signs of heart valve diseases — such as getting breathless while exercising or during typical activities — as normal signs of aging. You may also have no symptoms at all.
When symptoms of heart valve diseases occur, they can include:
Breathing problems,
including rapid breathing or difficulty breathing, especially when climbing stairs, moving fast, or otherwise exerting yourself
Chest pain or discomfort,
also called
angina
Dizziness,
fainting when standing up, or a short-term loss of consciousness
Feeling more tired than usual
Fever,
which may signal an infection that can lead to
heart inflammation
(called endocarditis)
Feeling like your heart is beating too fast or skipping a beat
Heart murmur,
an unusual sound that is heard between heartbeats
Swelling
around the eyes, ankles, or abdomen
These symptoms are similar to other conditions. Your doctor can do a test to look at your heart, called an echocardiogram, to
diagnose a heart valve problem
.","To diagnose a heart valve disease, your healthcare provider may review your medical history, do a physical exam, and order tests to check the shape of your heart and how well it works.","Your doctor will ask about your
risk factors
, your
symptoms
, and any related heart valve conditions that run in your family.
During a physical exam, your doctor may do the following:
Listen to your heart with a stethoscope for the sounds of a heart murmur or irregular rhythm.
Feel the strength of your pulse on your neck or arm.
Examine a newborn’s abdomen for signs of a liver that is larger than normal.","The echocardiogram is the most common test to diagnose a problem with the heart valves.
Echocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart is pumping blood. A type of echo called Doppler ultrasound shows how well blood flows through your heart's chambers and valves.
A patient having echocardiography
The patient lies on his left side. A sonographer moves the transducer on the patient’s chest, while viewing the echo pictures on a computer.
Echo can detect blood clots inside your heart, fluid buildup in the pericardium (the sac around the heart), tumors, and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your body. Echo also can help your doctor find the cause of abnormal heart sounds, such as heart murmurs. Your doctor also might use echo to see how well your heart responds to certain heart treatments.","To diagnose heart valve disease, your doctor may do other tests in addition to echocardiography.
Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart’s electrical activity. An EKG can show how fast your heart is beating, whether the rhythm of your heartbeats is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses passing through each part of your heart. You may have an EKG as part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease.
An EKG may be recorded in a doctor’s office, an outpatient facility, in a hospital before major surgery, or as part of stress testing. For the test, you will lie still on a table. A nurse or technician will attach up to 12 electrodes to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Your skin may need to be shaved to help the electrodes stick. The electrodes are connected by wires to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity on graph paper or on a computer. After the test, the electrodes will be removed.
An EKG has no serious risks. EKGs don’t give off electrical charges such as shocks. You may develop a slight rash where the electrodes were attached to your skin. This rash usually goes away on its own without treatment.
Chest X-ray
A chest X-ray is a fast and painless imaging test to look at the structures in and around your chest.
This test can help diagnose and check conditions such as pneumonia, heart failure, lung cancer, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and lung tissue scarring, called fibrosis. Doctors may use chest X-rays to see how well certain treatments are working and to check for complications after certain procedures or surgeries.
The test may be done in the doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. You will stand, sit, or lie still for the test.
Chest X-rays have few risks. The amount of radiation used in a chest X-ray is very small. Talk to your provider if you are or could be pregnant.
Stress test
A stress test measures how healthy your heart is and how well it works during physical stress. Some heart problems are easier to identify when your heart is working hard to pump blood throughout your body, such as when you exercise.
Your doctor may recommend this test if you have symptoms of a heart problem, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, and a rapid or irregular heartbeat. If your doctor does find a problem, the stress test also can help your doctor choose the right treatment plan and determine what types of physical activity are safe for you.
You may do a stress test in your doctor’s office or a hospital. The test usually involves physical exercise such as walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bicycle. If you are not able to exercise, your doctor will give you medicine that will make your heart work hard and beat faster, as if you were exercising. Your doctor may ask you not to take some of your prescription medicines or to avoid coffee, tea, or any drinks with caffeine on the day of your test, because these may affect your results. Your doctor will ask you to wear comfortable clothes and shoes for the test.
For the stress test, your doctor will put sticky patches called electrodes on your chest and attach a blood pressure cuff to your arm and a pulse monitor to your finger or other part of your body. Your doctor will measure your heart activity and blood pressure before you start the test.
You will slowly start to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle, and then gradually increase the treadmill speed or bicycle resistance until your heart is working at the target heart rate for your age. Most often, a stress test includes an electrocardiogram to measure your heart’s electrical activity as you exercise. Your doctor may also measure your blood oxygen level, blood pressure, and heart rate. During the test, you will exercise for 10 to 15 minutes. Your doctor will stop the test if you show any sign of a heart problem, or if you are too tired to continue the test. If you are not able to exercise, your doctor will give you medicine over a 10- to 20-minute period through an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels.
After the stress test, your doctor will measure your heart activity and blood pressure to make sure that both measurements are back within the normal range. You should be able to return to your normal activities right away."

about the importance of getting your blood pressure checked regularly and understanding what your numbers mean so you can better manage your heart disease risk.
Everyone who’s age 3 or older should have their blood pressure checked by a healthcare provider at least once a year. Your provider measures your blood pressure to see if it’s in a healthy range. Regular checks can also show how well treatment for high blood pressure is working.
Getting ready for a blood pressure measurement
Your provider will measure your blood pressure to see if you have higher-than-normal blood pressure. A blood pressure measurement is easy and painless and can be done in the provider’s office or clinic or at home. The provider uses a gauge, stethoscope, or electronic sensor and a blood pressure cuff to measure your blood pressure.
Prepare for the test by following a few simple steps:
Do not exercise, drink coffee, or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes before the test.
Go to the bathroom before the test.
For at least 5 minutes before the test, sit in a chair and relax.
Make sure your feet are flat on the floor.
Do not talk while you are relaxing or during the test.
Uncover your arm for the cuff.
Rest your arm on a table so it is supported and at the level of your heart.
Even if you do prepare, your blood pressure reading may not be accurate if:
You are excited or nervous. “White coat hypertension” refers to blood pressure readings that are higher in a provider’s office than readings at home or in a pharmacy. To detect this type of high blood pressure, your provider may review readings from the office and from other places.
Your blood pressure tends to be lower when measured at a provider’s office. This is called “masked high blood pressure.” When this happens, your provider will have difficulty detecting high blood pressure. Your provider can recognize this type of high blood pressure by looking at readings taken at the office and at home, especially at night.
The wrong blood pressure cuff was used. Your readings can be different if the cuff is too small or too big. It is important for your provider to use the correct pressure cuff for your sex and age.
You can also take your blood pressure at home or at a pharmacy. The
Self-Measured Blood Pressure Fact Sheet
has more information about how to measure your blood pressure outside of a provider’s office. If you take your own blood pressure at home, use an
approved home blood pressure device
to make sure the readings are correct.
What the numbers mean
Your blood pressure reading is made up of two numbers, the top,
systolic
,
number and the bottom,
diastolic
,
number. These numbers measure pressure in
mm HG
(millimeters of mercury). To learn more about systolic and diastolic pressure, visit
How the Heart Works
. For most adults, a healthy blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Your blood pressure is considered high when you have consistent systolic readings of 130 mm Hg or higher or diastolic readings of 80 mm Hg or higher.
Talk to your provider if your blood pressure readings are consistently higher than 120/80 mm Hg.
NHLBI-supported
research
has shown that systolic blood pressure higher than 120 mm Hg can cause harm to health over time, including organ damage. Readings above 180/120 mm Hg are dangerously high and require immediate medical attention.
For children younger than 13, blood pressure readings are compared with readings that are common for children of the same, age, sex, and height.
Blood Pressure Levels

Chest CT scan
For an accurate diagnosis, a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan is essential. It creates detailed pictures of your lungs and the inside of your chest. Computers can combine these pictures to create three-dimensional (3D) models showing the size, shape, and position of your lungs and other structures in your chest.

Lung function tests
Lung function tests
can help your healthcare provider determine how well your lungs are working. These tests may help diagnose certain lung conditions or diseases, including LAM.
Blood tests
Your healthcare provider may order blood tests, such as a test for vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) that looks for increased VEGF-D levels in your blood. Higher levels of VEGF-D can stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, which can enable the cells that cause LAM cells to spread in the body. About 70% of patients with LAM have raised VEGF-D levels.","If other tests cannot diagnose LAM, your healthcare provider may recommend a lung
biopsy

A lung biopsy
removes small pieces of your lung to check for LAM cells. Your provider may do an open lung biopsy, which involves making a cut in your chest wall between your ribs. With a transbronchial biopsy, your provider inserts a long tube down your windpipe and into your lungs. Whenever possible, the transbronchial biopsy is the preferred approach. Your healthcare provider can also diagnose LAM using results from biopsies of other tissues, such as the lymph nodes.
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)
may be done to remove small pieces of your lung to check for LAM cells, if your provider suspects LAM but is not able to diagnose using a traditional open lung or transbronchial biopsy.

Marfan Syndrome,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/marfan-syndrome,Marfan syndrome is a genetic condition that affects the connective tissues that support the body’s bones and organs. This condition can cause problems with the heart and blood vessels.,"Symptoms of Marfan syndrome depend on which parts of the body are affected and how severe the condition is. Some people have few or no symptoms, while others experience severe symptoms or
life-threatening complications
.
Some symptoms of Marfan syndrome may be visible to others:
A chest that sinks in or sticks out
A long head with deep-set eyes
A tall, thin body
Flat feet
Flexible joints
Long arms, legs, fingers, and toes
Other symptoms of Marfan syndrome are less obvious on the outside.
Eye problems
include blurred vision or trouble seeing things that are far away, are often the first sign of Marfan syndrome. These can be caused by the lens in one or both eyes moving out of place.
Heart palpitations
are what you feel when the heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast.
A heart murmur
is
an unusual sound between heartbeats that only your doctor can hear.
Pain
can occur in different parts of the body, particularly in the lower back.
Scoliosis
is
a condition marked by the curving of the spine to one side.
Stretch marks
not caused by weight gain or loss may appear on the skin. These stretch marks usually appear on the lower back, buttocks, shoulders, breasts, thighs, and stomach area.
Teeth that become too crowded or weak
are more likely to break or have cavities.

Your BMI is a measure of body fat based on your weight and height. It is important to know that body mass index is a screening tool and does not necessarily diagnose body fatness. Other related measures, such as waist circumference, are used to evaluate a person’s health and risk of overweight and obesity.
To calculate your BMI, use NHLBI’s
BMI calculator
.
BMI categories for adults
For adults:
Underweight
is a BMI of less than 18.5
Healthy weight
is a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9
Overweight
is a BMI of 25 to 29.9
Obesity
is a BMI of 30 or above
BMI categories for children
For children, height and weight are shown in percentiles. A child’s BMI percentile is calculated by comparing the child’s BMI to growth charts for children who are the same age and sex.
To learn your child’s percentile, use the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s
BMI percentile calculator for children and teens

Underweight
is a BMI below the 5th percentile.
Healthy weight
is a BMI between the 5th and the 85th percentile.
Overweight
is a BMI between the 85th percentile and the 95th percentile.
Obesity
is a BMI in or above the 95th percentile.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that providers screen for obesity in children beginning at age 6.","To better understand the health risks that overweight and obesity may pose to a specific person providers can measure the person’s distribution of body fat. You may have a normal BMI but if you have a large waist circumference, you may have more fat in your abdomen than elsewhere.
For men, an unhealthy waist circumference is greater than 40 inches.
For women, an unhealthy waist circumference is greater than 35 inches.
Fatty tissue is found in different parts of your body. Fatty tissue produces
hormones
, cushions your joints, and stores energy.
However, depending on where the fatty tissue is found, it may do more harm than good. Fatty tissue found inside your abdomen is called visceral or abdominal fat. We do not know what causes the body to create and store visceral fat. But we do know that this type of fat interferes with your body’s
endocrine
and immune systems. It also promotes
inflammation
and contributes to obesity-related complications, including
heart disease
and diabetes.
Talk to your healthcare provider about your BMI results and body fat distribution and what steps you may need to take to reach a healthy weight.","Sometimes other medical conditions or medicines that you take may lead to overweight and obesity.

Peripheral Artery Disease,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/peripheral-artery-disease,"Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is a condition in which a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body.","About 1 in 4 people with PAD experience common symptoms of the condition. More than half have nontypical symptoms, and about 1 in 5 people who have PAD do not report any symptoms. No matter the symptoms, everyone with PAD shares the same high risk of cardiovascular disease. Without
treatment,
PAD may cause sores, infections, and even the loss of a limb.
Symptoms of PAD can vary, but there are a few common ones.
Pain, aching, heaviness, or cramping in your legs
that comes when walking or climbing stairs and goes away after rest is called intermittent claudication. It is the most common PAD symptom. The pain is often in the calf, but you may also feel it in your buttocks, thigh, or foot.
Your toenails and leg hair may stop growing.
One foot may feel colder than the other.
Your foot or leg may become pale, discolored, or blue.
Leg weakness or numbness
may make you feel off-balance or make it harder to walk.
You may have pain or a feeling of pins and needles in your leg or foot.
In severe PAD, pain in your leg and foot when at rest
is called critical limb ischemia.
Sores or wounds on your toes, feet, or legs may appear, may heal slowly, or may not heal at all.
The sores may become infected.",N/A,N/A,"Your healthcare provider will diagnose peripheral artery disease (PAD) based on your medical and family history, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.","To help diagnose PAD, your provider will want to learn about your
symptoms,
risk factors
, personal health history, and family health history. This discussion may include questions about the following:
Other medical conditions,
including diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease
Pain or cramps
in your legs while walking or exercising
Problems with your legs and feet,
including swelling, redness, trouble with walking, and wounds that are slow to heal
Smoking,
either current or past
Your family history
of PAD, heart disease, and other blood vessel diseases
During an exam to look for signs of PAD, your provider will:
Check for weak pulses
in your legs.
Listen for poor blood flow in your legs.
Your provider will use a stethoscope to listen for an abnormal whooshing sound, called a bruit.
Look for problems on your legs and feet,
including swelling, sores, or pale skin.","Some conditions, such as
arthritis
or vein problems can cause leg pain, but the symptoms are different from those for PAD. A physical exam and your medical history can help your provider rule out these conditions.
However, problems with nerves can cause pain that may be confused with PAD. Sometimes a nerve is squeezed where it exits the spinal column. The result is pain that radiates, or spreads, from the hips or buttocks and down the leg.
To confirm that your pain is the result of PAD, your provider may ask you to stand up or change your position. Those movements often trigger nerve-related pain. In contrast, PAD pain is often brought on by leg exercise and is quickly relieved by rest with no need to change position.","The ankle-brachial index (ABI) test
is usually the first test used to diagnose PAD. The test compares blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm. Your provider uses a blood pressure cuff and
ultrasound
device for this painless test.
A drawing of the ankle-brachial index test.
A healthy ABI result is 1.00 or greater. If you have an ABI of less than 0.90 while resting, you may have PAD. An ABI of less than 0.40 is a sign of severe PAD. If there are problems with the arteries in your ankle, your provider may do a toe-brachial index (TBI) test instead, which measures the blood pressure in your big toe. A TBI less than 0.7 is abnormal.
Be aware of your ABI, just as you know and keep track of your blood pressure numbers.
To diagnose PAD, your provider may also order some of the following tests and procedures:
Blood tests
check your cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood sugar levels.
An exercise ABI test
shows the severity of your leg symptoms and the level of physical activity that produces them. Your provider will do the ABI test after having you walk on a treadmill. This test may help them diagnose PAD when you have symptoms but your resting ABI test result is only slightly low. A drop of 20% or more in a post-exercise ABI is abnormal.
A 6-minute walking test
measures how far you can walk in a hallway in 6 minutes. Your provider may do this test to see how much PAD affects your ability to function and how serious your PAD is.
Doppler ultrasound
locates areas of reduced blood flow or blockages and measures how fast blood is flowing through the arteries. A handheld device is passed over your skin, and a computer converts sound waves into pictures of the blood flow in your arteries. Ultrasound can help diagnose PAD and monitor how well treatments for the condition have worked.
Segmental Doppler pressure testing
checks different parts of your legs for narrowed or blocked arteries. This method is similar to ABI testing but uses blood pressure cuffs placed at thigh, calf, and ankle levels. The ultrasound device amplifies the sounds of blood flow in your arteries, making it easier to measure the blood pressure in these areas of your leg.
Your provider may also order an imaging test using angiography to get a better picture of the blood vessels in your legs and feet. There are several types of angiography:
Computed tomography angiography (CTA)
allows providers to see the arteries in your legs and feet. A special dye is injected, and then X-rays are taken to show the location and extent of any blood vessel blockages.
Magnetic resonance angiography
(MRA)
examines the structure of your leg arteries. MRA tests may not be safe for people who have metal implants in their body.
Catheter-based
angiography
lets providers see inside the arteries of your legs. A doctor inserts a catheter, or tube, into an artery in your groin and guides it to the affected area. A special dye is released through the catheter and then X-rays are taken. Your provider may suggest this procedure for serious pain in the legs or feet or when
treatments for PAD
have not worked or other testing has not been helpful."

They may also check the level of oxygen in your blood with a probe on your finger or forehead.
Your provider will listen to your breathing to find out whether your lungs are making any abnormal sounds.
If you have pleurisy,
the inflamed layers of the pleura may make a rough, scratchy sound as they rub against each other when you breathe. Doctors call this a pleural friction rub.
If you have a pleural effusion,
fluid buildup in the pleural space may prevent a friction rub. But if you have a lot of fluid, your provider may hear a dull sound when they tap on your chest.
If you have a pneumothorax,
your provider may hear more echo than usual when they tap on your chest.","Your provider may order a combination of the following tests to help diagnose a pleural disorder. These tests may also help  rule out other medical conditions that can cause chest pain.
Biopsies
take a sample of the pleura. The sample is checked for signs of disease.
Blood tests
show whether you have an illness that increases your risk of pleurisy or another pleural disorder
Lung imaging tests
such as a chest MRI or chest X-ray look for fluid or air in the pleural space or other possible causes of pleural disorders, such as pneumonia, a fractured rib, or a lung tumor.
Endoscopies
look for signs of disease, guide the doctor while performing a biopsy, or remove pleural fluid.
Thoracentesis
procedure removes a sample of pleural fluid for testing. The fluid removed during thoracentesis is tested and examined under a microscope for signs of infection, cancer, or other conditions that can cause fluid or blood to build up in the pleural space.
Ultrasounds
look for fluid, air, or other abnormal findings in your chest."
Pneumonia,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/pneumonia,Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes the air sacs to fill up with fluid or pus. This can make it hard to breathe.,"The symptoms of pneumonia can be mild or serious. Young children, older adults, and people who have serious health conditions are at

looks for inflammation in your lungs. A chest X-ray is often used to diagnose pneumonia.
Blood tests
,
such as a complete blood count (CBC) see whether your immune system is fighting an infection.
Pulse oximetry
measures how much oxygen is in your blood. Pneumonia can keep your lungs from getting enough oxygen into your blood. To measure the levels, a small sensor called a pulse oximeter is attached to your finger or ear.
If you are in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems, your provider may do other tests to diagnose pneumonia.
A blood gas test may be done
if you are very sick. For this test, your provider measures your blood oxygen levels using a blood sample from an artery, usually in your wrist. This is called an arterial blood gas test.
A sputum test, using a sample of sputum (spit) or mucus from your cough, may be used to
find out what germ is causing your pneumonia.
A blood culture
test can identify the germ causing your pneumonia and also show whether a bacterial infection has spread to your blood.
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
quickly checks your blood or sputum sample to find the
DNA
of germs that cause pneumonia.
A
bronchoscopy
looks inside your airways. If your treatment is not working well, this procedure may be needed. At the same time, your doctor may also collect samples of your lung tissue and fluid from your lungs to help find the cause of your pneumonia.
A
chest computed tomography (CT) scan
can show how much of your lungs are affected by pneumonia. It can also show whether you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural disorders. A CT scan shows more detail than a chest X-ray.
A pleural fluid culture can be taken using a procedure called
thoracentesis

Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/primary-ciliary-dyskinesia,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a rare inherited disorder in which hair-like structures in the lungs, called cilia, do not work properly. This can cause lung disease.","Babies born with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) may have
respiratory distress
within the first day after birth, while other people may go through life without knowing that they have the disease.
PCD affects mainly the sinuses, ears, and lungs. One sign that you might have PCD is if you have chronic (ongoing) infections, such as a wet cough and constant nasal congestion, in one or more of these areas. You may often get sinus infections and middle ear infections.
Symptoms in the body include:
Both men and women may have fertility problems, or difficulty having children.
About half of all people who have PCD have Kartagener’s syndrome, a rare condition that includes situs inversus (internal organs in a mirror image of their normal positions).
Symptoms in the sinuses include:
Chronic (long-term) nasal congestion
Runny nose with mucus and pus discharge
Chronic sinus infections
Nasal polyps
Symptoms in the ears include:
Chronic middle ear infections
Hearing loss
Symptoms in the lungs include:
Chronic cough
Respiratory distress (breathing problems) in newborns
Pneumonia
that goes away and comes back often
Atelectasis
Bronchiectasis","The symptoms of PCD and how serious they are can vary from person to person. A person who has the disease may have serious sinus, ear, or lung infections. If the disease is mild, it may not show up until the teen or adult years.
Your symptoms may also vary over time. Sometimes you may have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more serious.
Some people who have PCD have breathing problems when they are born and need
extra oxygen
for several days. Afterward, airway infections are common.
Diagnosing PCD
in children can be hard. This is because some PCD symptoms — such as ear infections, chronic cough, and runny nose — are common in children, even if they don’t have PCD. Also, the disease may be confused with another condition, such as
cystic fibrosis
.
A correct and early diagnosis of PCD is very important. It will allow you or your child to get the proper
treatment
to keep your airways and lungs as healthy as possible. An early diagnosis and proper treatment can also prevent or delay ongoing and long-term lung damage.","Make sure to report new or worsening symptoms, such as increased coughing, to your provider (or your child’s provider) right away. This will allow them to find out whether you have an infection and what’s causing it. Your provider can then prescribe medicine to prevent the infection from worsening.","Your healthcare provider or your child’s provider will diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) based on your
symptoms
,
family history
, and test results.","Researchers have found many
Genes
associated with PCD. Genetic testing can show whether you have faulty genes linked to the disease.
Genetic testing is done using a blood sample. The sample is taken from a vein in your body using a needle. The blood sample is checked at a special genetic testing laboratory (lab).
Couples who are planning to have children and know that they are at risk of having a child with PCD may want to meet with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor can answer questions about the risk and explain the choices that are available.","Your healthcare provider can use a special microscope, called an electron microscope, to look at samples of your airway cilia. This test can show whether there are any problems with the structure of your cilia or how they are working.
An ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or a pulmonologist (a doctor who specializes in treating conditions affecting the respiratory system, including the lungs) will take samples of your cilia. The provider will brush the inside of your nose to remove some cells from your airways. However, this test doesn’t give a final diagnosis.","Sometimes healthcare providers use one or more of the following tests to help diagnose PCD. Some of these tests are less complex than genetic testing and electron microscopy, and they can be done in a provider’s office.
Based on your test results, your provider may recommend a more complex test.
Ear, nose and throat tests:
Because ear and sinus symptoms are common in PCD, tests focused on those areas can determine if you have hearing loss or loss of your sense of smell. Exams could include pressure testing to check the eardrum for fluid buildup.
Lung function tests
:
These are a group of tests that evaluate how well the lungs work by measuring lung volume, rates of flow, and gas exchange. Lung function may be lower in people living with PCD than in those not living with the disease.
Nasal nitric oxide measurement:
This test measures the level of nitric oxide (a gas) when you breathe out. In people who have PCD, the level of nitric oxide is very low compared with normal levels. The reason for this is currently unknown.
Video microscopy:
For this test, a pulmonologist brushes the inside of your nose to get a sample of cilia. Then he or she looks at the cilia under a microscope to see how they move. Abnormal movement of the cilia may be a sign of PCD.
Radiolabeled particles:
For this test, you breathe in tiny particles that have a small, safe amount of radiation attached to them. Your provider will test how well your cilia can move the particles. If your lungs remove the particles more slowly than normal, your cilia may not be working well. This could be a sign of PCD.
Semen analysis:
This test is used for adult men. In men, PCD can affect cilia-like structures that help sperm cells move. As a result, men who have PCD may have fertility problems. For this test, a sample of semen is checked under a microscope. Sperm that don’t look normal or a low sperm count may be signs of PCD.
Chest computerized tomography (CT) or other imaging
:
This test checks for structural changes in the lung as a result of chronic infections. A thorough physical exam, followed by an
X-ray of the chest
and abdomen and
echocardiography
, will also identify most cases of situs inversus.
Your provider also might want to do tests to rule out diseases and disorders that have symptoms similar to those of PCD. For example, you may have tests to rule out
cystic fibrosis
or immune disorders."
Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a serious long-term disease that happens when the tissue surrounding the air sacs, or alveoli, in the lungs becomes thick and stiff for unknown reasons. In most cases, the cause is not known, and this is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",The symptoms of IPF develop over time. Symptoms may be different between people and may develop slowly or quickly.,"The most common symptoms are:
Shortness of breath that gets worse over time.
At first, you may be short of breath only during exercise. Over time, you may feel breathless even at rest.
A dry
cough
that gets worse.
You may have repeated bouts of coughing that you cannot control.
Other symptoms may include:
Aching muscles and joints
Clubbing
,
which is a widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes
Extreme tiredness
Gradual, unintended weight loss
Generally feeling unwell
Rapid, shallow breathing",N/A,"Your doctor will diagnose IPF based on your
symptoms
, your medical and family history, your
risk factors
, and the results from tests and procedures. Idiopathic means that your doctors cannot determine a cause of your disease at the time of diagnosis. They will rule out other medical reasons or conditions that may be causing your symptoms before diagnosing you with IPF. This may be done by doing other tests and talking to specialists.
Medical history and physical exam
To help determine whether you have IPF and rule out other possible causes of lung problems, your doctor may ask about your medical history and possible risk factors.
Your doctor may look for signs
of IPF during a physical exam, such as:
Blue hands and feet
from not enough oxygen in the blood
Clubbing
of the fingers or toes
High-pitched crackles
when listening to your lungs
Diagnostic tests and procedures
To diagnose IPF, your doctor may order some of the following tests and procedures.
High resolution
chest CT scan
, or HRCT:
This is used to take pictures of the inside of your lungs and look for scarring or
inflammation
. CT scans can also help distinguish between types of lung diseases. For IPF, doctors look for a pattern where the lungs look similar to a honeycomb.
Lung
biopsy
:
This is used to see if your lung tissue shows signs of inflammation, scarring, or other changes. This procedure is sometimes used to verify the diagnosis of IPF. It usually is done by thoracoscopic surgery, in which small incisions are made and a small camera is used to direct surgical instruments.
Chest X-ray
: This is used to take pictures of the lungs and look for evidence of inflammation or damage such as scarring. An X-ray does not provide as much detail as a high-resolution CT scan.
Tests for other medical conditions
Your doctor may perform some tests and procedures to help rule out other conditions that may cause lung disorders.
Blood tests
, such as an
antibody
test:
This is used to look for signs of an
autoimmune
disease that can cause lung scarring.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL):
This is used to look at the types of cells in your lung fluid. Sometimes it may be used when the types of cells can help distinguish between IPF and other lung diseases.
Lung function tests
:
This is used to see if you show signs of reduced breathing capacity or abnormal blood oxygen levels. These tests help assess the severity of your lung disease, and they can help monitor whether your condition is stable or worsening over time.
genetics
testing:
This is used to see if you have
mutations
, or changes in your
Genes

Pulmonary Hypertension,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/pulmonary-hypertension,Pulmonary hypertension occurs when the pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs is higher than normal. This makes the heart have to work harder to pump blood into the lungs.,"Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are sometimes hard to recognize. People may have symptoms for years before being diagnosed. This is because many symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are also symptoms of other medical conditions.
Some symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:
Chest pain
Coughing
that is dry or produces blood
Shortness of breath
Dizziness
that may lead to fainting
Nausea and vomiting
Hoarseness
Fatigue
Swelling
of the abdomen, legs, or feet
Weakness
Wheezing,
which is a whistling sound when you breathe out
Symptoms can get worse over time. For example, in the early stages of pulmonary hypertension, you may only have shortness of breath with exercise. As the disease progresses, shortness of breath will occur more often.","If you experience chest pain and shortness of breath, seek emergency medical care. This may be a
sign of a heart attack
or a blood clot in your lungs (
pulmonary embolism
).",N/A,"To diagnose pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may ask you questions about your medical history and do a physical exam. Based on your
symptoms
and
risk factors
, your doctor may refer you to a lung specialist (pulmonologist) or a heart and blood vessel specialist (cardiologist). Your doctor will diagnose you with pulmonary hypertension if tests show higher-than-normal pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary arteries).","Your doctor may ask you about any symptoms you have been experiencing and any risk factors such as other medical conditions you have.
Your doctor will also perform a physical exam to look for signs that may help diagnose your condition. As part of this exam, your doctor may do the following:
Check whether the oxygen levels in your blood are low. This may be done by pulse oximetry, in which a probe is placed on your finger to check your oxygen levels.
Feel your liver to see if it is larger than normal.
Listen to your heart to see if there are changes in how it sounds, and also to find out if your heartbeat is faster than normal or irregular or if you have a new heart murmur.
Listen to your lungs for sounds that could be caused by
heart failure
or
interstitial lung disease
.
Look at the veins in your neck to see if they are larger than normal.
Look for swelling in your abdomen and legs that may be caused by fluid buildup.
Measure your blood pressure.","There are many tests that doctors can use to tell if you have pulmonary hypertension.
The most common tests to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries are
cardiac catheterization
and
echocardiography
. Normal pressure in the pulmonary arteries is between 11 and 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). If the pressure is too high, you may have pulmonary hypertension. A pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater measured by cardiac catheterization or 35 to 40 mm Hg or greater on echocardiography suggests pulmonary hypertension.
Other tests may include:
Blood tests
look for blood clots, stress on the heart, or anemia.
Heart imaging tests
,
such as cardiac MRI, take detailed pictures of the structure and functioning of the heart and surrounding blood vessels.
Lung imaging tests
,
such as chest X-ray, looks at the size and shape of the heart and surrounding blood vessels, including the pulmonary arteries.
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)
looks for changes in the electrical activity of your heart. This can help detect if certain parts of the heart are damaged or working too hard. In pulmonary hypertension, the heart can become overworked due to damage or changes in the pulmonary arteries.","Your doctor may order additional tests to see whether another condition or medicine may be causing your pulmonary hypertension. Doctors can use this information to develop your
treatment plan

Before diagnosing you with sarcoidosis, your healthcare provider will rule out other possible conditions.","Doctors use stages to describe sarcoidosis of the lung or lymph nodes of the chest. The stages are based on where the lumps, or granulomas, are found and whether there is scarring on imaging tests. Stage IV is the most serious and means you have permanent scarring in the lungs.","Bring a list of
symptoms
with you to your appointment. Tell your provider if you live or work near insecticides or mold or have other
risk factors

Check your temperature.
Check to see if your lymph nodes, spleen, or liver are swollen.
Listen to your chest with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out.
Look for rashes or sores on your body, such as scalp and lower legs.","There are no screening tests to determine who will develop sarcoidosis. If you are at risk for sarcoidosis, your provider may talk to you about trying to avoid certain substances in your environment that can trigger granulomas.
Your healthcare provider may have you undergo certain tests and procedures to diagnose sarcoidosis.
Chest X-rays
look for granulomas or scarring in the lungs and heart. This will also help figure out the stage of the disease. Often, sarcoidosis is found because a chest X-ray is done for another reason.
biopsy
of the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, or other affected organs may help confirm your sarcoidosis diagnosis. Your doctor will do a
bronchoscopy
to get the biopsy sample from your lungs or lymph nodes in your chest.
Blood tests
check your blood counts, hormone levels, and how well your kidneys are working.
Other imaging tests
look for granulomas or inflammation in the heart, eyes, lymph nodes, or other areas. These may include
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or an ultrasound.
The tests below look at how sarcoidosis is affecting the body.
Neurological tests
,

Today's Faces of Sickle Cell Disease: Cassandra Trimnell
In 1987, Cassandra Trimnell became the first child in Iowa to be diagnosed with sickle cell disease through the state’s newborn screening program.
Read Cassandra’s story.","If you do not know whether you have sickle cell trait or disease, you can find out by having a blood test. Blood tests can determine if your body makes the hemoglobin S protein and how much. Gene testing can tell if you have one or two copies of the hemoglobin S gene. Similar tests can also look for other abnormal hemoglobin types. Genetic tests can help confirm a sickle cell disease diagnosis if results from blood tests are not clear. Some people who have sickle cell disease have one gene for sickle hemoglobin and another gene for a different type of faulty hemoglobin that causes diseases such as
thalassemia
. Genetic testing or blood tests can check for these conditions.","Healthcare providers can also diagnose sickle cell disease before a baby is born. This can be done in two ways. The first uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo). The second uses a sample taken from the placenta (the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the womb).
Testing before birth can be done as early as 8 to 10 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin itself. This testing cannot tell you how serious the disease symptoms will be.","Newborn screening
In newborn screening programs, healthcare providers prick the heel of the newborn and collect drops of blood on a special card. A lab tests the hemoglobin in the sample and sends the test results to the provider who ordered the test and to your child’s healthcare provider. The most commonly used tests are high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis (CE) and isoelectric focusing (IEF).
Providers from a special follow-up newborn screening team will contact you directly if your child has sickle cell disease. Your child’s providers will then retest your child to confirm the diagnosis. They may also recommend genetic testing.
Newborn screening programs also find out whether your baby has
sickle cell trait
and is a carrier of the hemoglobin S gene. If this is the case, genetic counseling will be offered. Remember that when a child has sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, their future siblings or your child’s future children may be a carrier of the hemoglobin S gene.

The type of symptoms depends on the type of stroke and the area of the brain that is affected.
This animation discusses symptoms of stroke, also described below.
Medical Animation Copyright © 2023 Nucleus Medical Media, All rights reserved.
Signs of a TIA or stroke may include:
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or trouble understanding speech
Sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body
Sudden severe headache with no known cause
Sudden trouble seeing from one or both eyes
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination
The FAST test can help you remember what to do if you think someone is having a stroke.

T — Time:
If you observe any of these signs,
call 9-1-1 right away.
Early treatment is essential.
If you think you or someone else may be having a TIA or stroke, do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke,
every minute counts.","A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or death. When you have a stroke, your doctor may rate how serious it is. A serious stroke means more brain was damaged. When there is significant damage, your doctor may call it a massive stroke. This can mean there may be severe complications.
After a stroke, you may develop complications.
Dangerous blood clots may form.
Being unable to move around for a long time can raise your risk of
developing blood clots
in the deep veins of the legs. In some cases, blood clots can break loose and travel to the lungs. Your stroke team may try to prevent these complications with medicine or a device that puts pressure on your calves to keep your blood flowing.
Loss of bladder or bowel control can occur.
Some strokes affect the muscles needed to urinate and have bowel movements. You may need a urinary catheter (a tube placed into the bladder) until you can urinate on your own. Use of these catheters can lead to urinary tract infections. You may also lose control of your bowels or be constipated.
Loss of bone density or strength is also common.
This usually happens on one side of the body. Making physical activity part of your rehabilitation can help prevent this loss. Your care team may also watch closely for
osteoporosis
.
Muscle weakness or inability to move may also occur.
A stroke can make your muscles become weak and stiff or cause them to spasm. This can be painful or make it hard to stand or walk around on your own. You may also have problems with balance or controlling your muscles. This puts you at risk of falling.
Problems with language, thinking, or memory are another possible complication.
Stroke may affect your ability to focus on a task or make decisions quickly. It also raises the risk of
dementia
.
Seizures can occur.
This is more common in the weeks after a stroke and is less likely as time goes on. If you have seizures, your stroke team may give you medicine to try to control them.
Swelling in the brain is also possible.
After a stroke, fluid may build up between the brain and the skull or in the cavities of the brain, causing swelling. Doctors may drain fluid from the brain or cut away part of the skull to relieve the pressure the fluid puts on your brain.
You may experience loss of vision, hearing, or touch.
Your ability to feel pain or temperature may be affected after a stroke, or you may have trouble seeing or hearing as well as before. Some of these changes could affect your ability to cook, read, change your clothes, or do other tasks.
You may experience problems swallowing and
pneumonia
.
If a stroke affects the muscles used for swallowing, you may have a hard time eating or drinking. You may also be at risk of inhaling food or drink into your lungs. If this happens, you may develop pneumonia.
You may have difficulty speaking.
If a stroke affects the muscles you use to speak, you may have trouble communicating as easily as before.",N/A,"Your doctor will diagnose a stroke based on your
symptoms
, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your healthcare provider will want to find out the type of stroke you have had, its cause, the part of the brain that is affected, and whether you have bleeding in the brain. If your doctor thinks you have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), they will look for the cause to try to prevent a future stroke.","Your healthcare provider will order tests to help rule out other health problems with similar signs or symptoms.
Imaging tests look at the blood vessels in your brain. These images will help determine what type of stroke you had and exactly where it happened in your brain. The faster these tests can be done, the better your doctor can diagnose and treat you. There are several imaging tests used to diagnose stroke.
Computed tomography (CT)
uses X-rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your brain. It is often done right after a suspected stroke. A brain CT scan can show whether there is bleeding in the brain or damage to the brain cells from a stroke.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of your brain. An MRI may be used instead of — or in addition to — a CT scan to diagnose a stroke. This test can identify changes in brain tissue and damage to brain cells.
Other imaging tests
may include digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and
positron emission tomography (PET)
to look for narrowed blood vessels in the neck, an
aneurysms
, or an arteriovenous malformation (AVM, or tangled blood vessels) in the brain.
Your doctor may also order other tests.
Blood tests
will test the red blood cell and platelet count and glucose (sugar) levels in your blood to make sure they are stable. These tests can also help determine whether a specific medicine can treat your stroke. Your doctor may also do blood tests to see how well your blood is clotting and to look for muscle damage.
Electrocardiogram (EKG)
can help find heart problems that may have led to a stroke. For example, this test can help diagnose
atrial fibrillation
or a previous
heart attack
.
Lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap)
may be used if the imaging scan does not find any bleeding in the brain but your provider still thinks you may have had a hemorrhagic stroke. In this test, a needle is used to collect fluid from around your spine. The fluid is tested for substances that come from damaged blood cells.","Your doctor will ask you or a family member about your
risk factors
for stroke. Tell your provider if you or someone in your family has had a stroke. Your provider will also ask about your signs and symptoms and when they began. During a physical exam, your provider will check you for the following:
Confusion
Coordination and balance
Mental alertness
Numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs
Trouble speaking or seeing clearly
The exam helps your provider determine how severe your stroke was and plan treatment.
Your doctor will look for signs of carotid artery disease, a common cause of ischemic stroke. They will listen to your
Carotid artery
with a stethoscope. A whooshing sound called a bruit may suggest changed or lowered blood flow from
plaque
buildup in the carotid arteries.",N/A

Thalassemia,https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/thalassemia,Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes the body to make fewer healthy red blood cells and less of a protein called hemoglobin than usual.,"The symptoms of thalassemia are caused by
anemia
. Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood produces a lower-than-normal amount of healthy red blood cells. Anemia often develops in people with thalassemia because the body cannot make enough hemoglobin. Without enough hemoglobin, red blood cells in your blood stream cannot work properly to effectively deliver oxygen to cells throughout your body.

Symptoms of anemia include:
Feeling tired or weak
Shortness of breath
Paleness
Dizziness and fainting
Headaches
Depending on the type of thalassemia you have, you may experience mild anemia or no symptoms at all.","Children who have more serious types of thalassemia often have symptoms by the time they are 2 years old. These can include:
Pale skin or yellowing of the skin and eyes (
jaundice
)
A large abdomen from a spleen or liver that is larger than normal
Changes or problems with bones in the face
Dark urine
Poor appetite
Intellectual or developmental disabilities
More serious forms of thalassemia are often diagnosed during the newborn screening. Learn more about how thalassemia is
diagnosed
.",N/A,"The ways that a healthcare provider diagnoses thalassemia depends on the type of thalassemia you have. If you have minor or no symptoms, your provider may suspect thalassemia based on the results of a routine blood test. Other types of thalassemia cause more severe symptoms that can be found earlier in life, usually before a child is 2 years old.
To determine whether you or your child have thalassemia, your provider may ask about your
risk factors
, including your family’s and your medical history. Since thalassemia is inherited through genes, your provider may also ask whether someone in your family has thalassemia.
Your provider might also order blood or genetic tests.","Your provider may order the following tests to determine whether you or your child have thalassemia:
Complete blood count (CBC)
measures the amount of hemoglobin and different types of blood cells (such as red blood cells) in your blood. People who have thalassemia have fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin than normal. Depending on the type of thalassemia, your red blood cells may look smaller and show signs of disease under a microscope.
Special hemoglobin tests
measure the types of hemoglobin in a sample of blood. This test can help to distinguish between different medical conditions caused by problems with hemoglobin.

Blood tests
measure substances in the blood that may be signs of a blood clot. D-dimer tests
measure a substance in the blood that is released when the fibrin
protein
(proteins that help stop bleeding) in a clot dissolve. If the test shows high levels of the substance, you may have DVT. These tests may be used as a first step to look for signs of a blood clot in otherwise healthy people. Your provider can also check the
oxygen
levels in your blood. Low blood oxygen can be a sign of a blood clot.
Ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan
measures air flow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) in the lungs. If your lungs do not get the right amount of air or blood, you may have pulmonary embolism.
Pulmonary angiography
confirms pulmonary embolism if, after other testing, your healthcare provider suspects you have one. This test requires inserting a tube into your blood vessel. It also uses X-rays to create video of the blood flow to your lung so your provider can identify any blood clots.
